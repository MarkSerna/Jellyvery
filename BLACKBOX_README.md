## Code Explanation

The Jellyvery application is built using PHP and MySQL. The following code snippets provide a step-by-step explanation of how the application works:

```php
// Connect to the MySQL database
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "jellyvery");

// Get the list of locations from the database
$sql = "SELECT * FROM locations";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

// Create an array of locations
$locations = array();
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
  $locations[] = $row;
}

// Calculate the distance between each pair of locations
$distances = array();
foreach ($locations as $i => $location1) {
  foreach ($locations as $j => $location2) {
    if ($i != $j
